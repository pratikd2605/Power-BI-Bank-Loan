# ðŸ’¼ Bank Loan Insights Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview  
This project focuses on building an advanced **Power BI dashboard solution** for analyzing bank loan data to support strategic decision-making, risk assessment, and operational efficiency. Traditional reports often lack interactivity and depth. This dashboard suite addresses those gaps by providing dynamic, drillable, and richly visualized insights into borrower demographics, lending trends, and loan performance.

The solution consists of **three interconnected dashboards**â€”**Executive Summary**, **Trends & Overview**, and **Detailed Insights**â€”designed with the goal of transforming raw loan data into actionable intelligence.

The objective of this project was to create a **centralized, interactive, and insightful dashboard** to analyze and visualize key loan performance metrics, borrower behavior, and financial indicators in real time.

To craft a **multi-layered Power BI dashboard system** that offers:  
- Executive-level KPIs  
- Lending and demographic trends  
- Deep-dive drill-through analysis
